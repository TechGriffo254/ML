## Setup Instructions

### 1. Python Environment

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv ml_env
ml_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source ml_env/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. VS Code Extensions
The following extensions are recommended and should be installed:
- Python
- Pylance
- Jupyter
- Black Formatter
- autopep8

## Getting Started

1. **Data Exploration**: Start with notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder
2. **Data Processing**: Use the `src/` folder for reusable data processing functions
3. **Model Development**: Experiment with models in notebooks, then move production code to `src/`
4. **Model Storage**: Save trained models in the `models/` folder

## Key Libraries Included

- **Data Manipulation**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm
- **Development**: jupyter, pytest, black, flake8

## Best Practices

1. Keep raw data unchanged in `data/raw/`
2. Use version control (git) for your code
3. Document your code and experiments
4. Use virtual environments for dependency management
5. Write tests for your functions

## Optional Deep Learning Setup

For deep learning projects, uncomment the TensorFlow or PyTorch lines in `requirements.txt` and reinstall dependencies.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
